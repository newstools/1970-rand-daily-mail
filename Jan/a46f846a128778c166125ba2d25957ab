It was not.But Maimane contradicted her, saying:Let&#39;s make this clear: Colonialism, like Apartheid, was a system of oppression and subjugation. It can never be justified.Party&nbsp;member&sbquo; Mbali Ntuli&sbquo; who has on several occasions called her out on her opinions and tweets&sbquo; disagreed with her.&ldquo;It was ONLY negative!! Colonialism=development argument is trash as those subjugated can attest to (sic)&sbquo;&rdquo; replied Ntuli.Ntuli is former DA youth leader and she is currently an MPL at the KwaZulu-Natal legislature.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like saying Nazism was good for German democracy and their advancements in technology&sbquo;&rdquo; added Ntuli.But Zille&sbquo; replying to another twitter user&sbquo; @GrahamDowns&sbquo; said: &ldquo;I do not know what positive Hitler produced. He stoked up nationalism and authoritarianism and genocide&sbquo; and destruction.&rdquo;Radio talk-show host, Eusebius McKaiser&rlm; replied to Zille's apology, saying:No Helen No. It didn&#39;t &quot;come across as a defence&quot; of colonialism.
