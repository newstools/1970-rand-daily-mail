Although not cited as respondents President Jacob Zuma and ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe were drawn into a courtroom drama that played out in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday.There in the KwaZulu-Natal capital ANC rebel branches sought to nullify the party's "rigged" 2015 provincial conference. Adv Tembeka Ngcukaitobi who is representing the aggrieved branches called out every member of the ruling party's Top Six saying they were complicit in the alleged wrongdoing that saw Sihle Zikalala and his slate trounce that of Senzo Mchunu and his supporters at the 2015 elective conference.Mchunu who was ANC KZN chairman and provincial Premier at the time was roundly beaten by Zikalala who is now the economic development MEC."My clients met with President Jacob Zuma on December 12 2015 in Durban. He undertook to refer the matter to the NEC [national executive committee] and respond to the applicants in five days. However he never fulfilled the undertaking " said Ngcukaitobi.He added that the applicants approached Mantashe in writing in April 2016 for further relief."For five months they waited for Zuma and that is why they wrote to the ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe. He told the complainants that he shouldn't be addressed through lawyers as the complainants had used their lawyers to write to him " he said.Ngcukaitobi said his clients had done a responsible thing by approaching Zuma and Mantashe. He said if they had written to Mantashe in January 2016 they would have been accused of rushing things while the leadership was "still seized" with the matter and because Zuma had not returned with answers.He said this passage of time meant the applicants had no choice but to seek relief from the court.He said approaching the NEC through the officials was because it was the biggest decision-making body between conferences and had the power to either call for fresh elections or declare the conference unlawful."Zuma and Mantashe did not create the impression that they were interested but the opposite " he said.Another applicant s lawyer Adv Griffiths Madonsela touched on the issue of a tweet that was sent out on November 7 2015 while the voting was under way.The tweet sent from the party's official @KZNANC account allegedly stated that Mchunu had garnered 675 votes."And indeed the next day when the results came out it emerged that Mchunu had received 675 votes. No matter how prophetic you can be no one can predict with such precision while the voting which was through a secret ballot was under way and counting had not been done " he said.Madonsela said the applicants had also not been provided with the voters roll by the respondents.The entire top five of the party's KZN structures - including chair Zikalala his deputy Willies Mchunu secretary Super Zuma his deputy Mluleki Ndobe and treasurer Nomusa Dube-Ncube - attended the trial.After a lunch break the ANC's lawyer Adv Greg Harper argued that the complainants had allowed the conference to proceed and did not object."They did not even challenge the results after they came out and only did so much later " he said.Meanwhile outside supporters of the two factions chanted and sang - and had to be kept apart by police. A number of streets in the Pietermaritzburg CDB were closed as multitudes were bussed in.- TimesLIVE Need to stay informed?
