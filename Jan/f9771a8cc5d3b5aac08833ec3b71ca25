Never has a country been so self-aware of its shortcoming, yet so apparently impotent to act on correcting them.&nbsp;The South African state today is characterised by increasing turmoil in ethical and efficient governance, deteriorating democratic accountability and threats to our independent institutional capacity.&nbsp;Yet at the same time, the country is more open to debate, deeply introspective discussions and self-critique than ever before.True to form, South Africa remains a contradiction. It has always been a land of juxtaposed images &nbsp;&nbsp; from legislated separation to defiant integration; extreme poverty to conspicuous wealth and from the best democratic ideals to the worst authoritarian tendencies. These have all worked side-by-side for the better part of our recent history.Recent events relating to seemingly endemic corruption, failed governance oversight and the Gupta Leaks have once again exposed our penchant for a parallel life of good and bad.However, political actors are complicit in maintaining a strange dual existence that attempts to placate an electorate with impressive (and perhaps even courageous) rhetoric while avoiding the tough - and potentially unpleasant- real retributive actions that will be necessary to take the country forward.The ANC have always tried to have it all ways. The composition of the Alliance was such that it covered all the bases Trade Unionists, Communists, Capitalists, Socialists and even populists when Julius Malema was still in the Youth League. The party could therefore almost theatrically and on script provide a host of sub-brands that could appeal to as broad-a-church-as-possible.In corporatist terms, this was a winning strategy and one of the real strengths of the post 1994-Alliance. The sub-elements may have critiqued each other, but they always returned to the fold to forge cohesiveness and the protect the mother-ship .Those were the days. COSATU is but a shadow of its former self and the SACP are threatening to contest the 2019 elections as a separate entity while leadership contestation is sewing further seeds of schism. Populism is fragmented towards the EFF while Socialists and struggle veterans now work on the periphery and beyond the formal ANC structures.But still, the ANC are today attempting to play one more hand of being everything to everyone. In their reaction to state capture and the Gupta Leaks, one side of the party is speaking out with apparent conviction, gusto and bravery. From Mahkosi Khoza, Derek Hanekom, Lindiwe Sisulu, Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas to Zizi Kodwa and even Cyril Ramaphosa and Zweli Mkhize, there is a clarion call for full accountability and for legal recourse.It is pretty impressive stuff. And, if compared with the creeping authoritarianism of Turkey or Russia, one might even praise South Africa for the honesty with which these issues are now being confronted.On one level of South Africa s parallel universe therefore, there is a society so aware, so forthright, so in tune with where we should be as a country. And yet, not too far away in a neighbouring dimension, all that is wrong lurks in tandem.Politically there are also two parallel ANCs one that s robust and pragmatic, the other that s deceptive and destructive.But parallel worlds are not enough. With little political will for any serious investigation into the Gupta Leaks at present, a National Director of Public Prosecutions who seems to have taken cover, a President and his family so deeply compromised by all sorts of intrigues and a plethora of implicated cabinet ministers still enjoying their day jobs, the institutional and brand damage continues unabated.This is an untenable position for both the party and the country. The kicking-for-touch on any real investigation is complicated by the ANC s elective conference at the end of the year.It is now entirely possible that factions can coalesce not around the broad interests of the country and future growth strategies but rather around either protecting (or prosecuting) those implicated in nefarious activities.With a raft of governance-related actions that may now be deemed at worst criminal or at best, ill-advised, the creation of slates and candidate options may reflect more a desire to protect those from prosecution than a genuine attempt to re-boot the ANC and in-so-doing, South Africa.Indeed, the eventual future of Jacob Zuma is also likely now to be an issue of which faction is most likely if the need arises - to grant any sort of legal pardon to the President should he face a negative judgement in the courts relating to corruption charges.December will now be about the survival of those implicated in both above-the-line and below-the-line wrongdoings.As both the President and National Prosecuting Authority prevaricate and delay, little effort will be made before December to proceed with a legal argument for prosecution. It will all now rest on what type of leadership is elected in December and those seeking to escape the consequences will be seeking slates that match this need.So, despite the well-intentioned calls by the pragmatic faction for accountability, it s the elective conference that might have to be a real arbiter amidst the complexity of leadership and policy battles.This adds a burden without precedence that the ANC might not be able to bare.It s one thing to have a healthy clash of personality when it comes to choosing a new leader (and national President). It s quite another to choose a new leadership team that has to confront the possibility of throwing comrades and colleagues to the legal wolves.So, for the moment, the best the ANC can do is allow a parallel insurgent grouping the chance to express their more critical view on the abuse of power, capture of centres of government and political abuse of institutions.In tandem, the parallel universe of transgressors will attempt to fire second-string underlings to deflect from their own dereliction of duty or alleged complicity.So long as the insurgent grouping keeps the issues in the public eye, the ANC will be deemed to be tackling the issue . The parallel forces of Khoza, Gordhan et al may be doing their bit to keep the right side of the discourse in the public eye, but ultimately this is not enough and it presents a veneer of accountability when we are far off from any progress in this regard.What South Africa should be doing right now, is the equivalent of what is happening in the United States re the investigation into Russian meddling in that country s 2016 election.South Africa needs its own Robert Mueller -&nbsp; a figure of impeccable bi-partisan respect to seek out the truth.&nbsp; Without our own Mueller, we leave the offenders themselves to be judge and jury at the ANC s own national elective conference a position that certainly does not serve the interests of South Africa nor that of the ANC in the longer term.South Africa requires a parallel process of legal investigation not an intra-party playbook as impressive as it might seem. The fact that we do not have this as yet, will further retard the re-capture of the State into ethical hands. Need to stay informed?
