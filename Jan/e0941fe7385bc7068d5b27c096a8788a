The motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma has failed: the 177 MPs who voted in favour of it were outvoted by 198 against. There were nine abstentions, and five MPs were absent a source of contention.The motion required 201 votes to pass, and the ANC s 249 MPs meant that if all opposition MPs voted in favour, at least 50 ANC MPs would have had to vote with them.The final tally suggests at least 20 ANC MPs voted against the party line.The outcome the more widely expected result will be a relief to the ANC, which is struggling with deep internal divisions, and Zuma s unseating would have left the party in chaos.But it widens the rift in the tripartite alliance, and provides more impetus for the SACP to make good on threats to go it alone.Zuma s survival also continues to present the opposition with ammunition, not least because the president is implicated in state caoture allegations, along with presiding over an economy in recession that is shedding jobs, and where business confidence is at rock bottom.Zuma has survived seven previous attempts to unseat him.The latest was different, though, not only because the vote was conducted in secret, but because it came at a time when opinion has been turning against Zuma, from within and outside the ANC, as evidence of corruption and state capture mounted.The motion was filed by the DA in reaction to Zuma s late-night Cabinet reshuffle earlier this year.
