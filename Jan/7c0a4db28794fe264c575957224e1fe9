I&rsquo;m about to miss my flight. Boarding time is at 6:30 and it&rsquo;s 6:28 now.&ldquo;I can tell you one thing for sure&sbquo; I will not ever support a metered taxi again. And it has only made me more resolute to use Uber taxis. It&rsquo;s completely unacceptable bullying tactics by the meter taxis&sbquo;&rdquo; she added.Aki Anastasiou&rlm; tweeted: &ldquo;Avoid the R24 in both directions heading twds &amp; from ORT.
