According to section 178(3) of the Constitution&sbquo; members of the JSC serve until they are replaced by those who designated them&sbquo;&rdquo; Jeffery wrote in an article published on The Daily Maverick website.&ldquo;So when the President chose to relieve Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza SC&sbquo; Advocate Ismael Semenya SC&sbquo; and Andiswa Ndoni of their positions&sbquo; the EFF were quick to come up with conspiracy theories.&ldquo;What they didn&rsquo;t say was that the three commissioners had already been serving on the JSC for eight years &hellip; What the EFF also didn&rsquo;t mention was that when these three commissioners were initially appointed there was criticism against their appointments too.&rdquo;&nbsp;-&nbsp;TMG Digital Need to stay informed?
