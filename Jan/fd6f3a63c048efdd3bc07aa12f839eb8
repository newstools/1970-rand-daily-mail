As acting CEO, he was tasked with turning around the ailing agency.In her affidavit, Peters contends that the R5.9-million a year Letsoalo would have earned was applicable to the position at the time of his appointment.The package is the same as that given to Montana.Peters also dismissed the argument that Letsoalo was entitled only to his basic salary at the department and an additional 12% acting allowance, in line with the agency s remuneration policy. The minister said the policy provided that acting-in-high-grade allowance will be applicable to all employees at 12% of total guaranteed package [total cost to company] .Peters said this clause did not apply to Letsoalo because he was not a permanent Prasa employee. She said the clause was applicable to permanent Prasa employees and those whose contracts were for more than six months. She emphasised that part of the clause that stated it is not applicable to temporary personnel from third-party employers .The minister said Letsoalo was categorised as temporary personnel from third-party employers and therefore the 12% referred to was not applicable to him. Indeed, it would have been anomalous for Mr Letsoalo to continue earning an amount of R1.3-million [a year] when his immediate subordinates at Prasa were earning upwards of R4-million, Peters said in her affidavit.Peters was replying to arguments by former board members, who have taken her department to court over their unceremonious removal last week. The board members are demanding immediate reinstatement.In his founding affidavit, former board chairman Popo Molefe attached a copy of the report from the board requested by Peters with regard to Letsoalo s axing.In the report, Molefe argues that Letsoalo s salary hike was in breach of the agency s remuneration policy as well as of the strictures governing the secondment of South African public service employees.A legal opinion obtained by the agency held that the increment was irregular because there was a distinction between someone acting as a CEO and someone appointed to the position.In his affidavit, Molefe argues that Letsoalo s pay increase did not have board approval and was, therefore, irregular.The board removed Letsoalo following a Sunday Times report that revealed that he had demanded the increase along with a chauffeur-driven car and a company cellphone without board approval.Letsoalo has returned to his position as CFO in the Department of Transport, but it appears he still believes he holds the position of acting CEO of Prasa.- The Times Need to stay informed?
