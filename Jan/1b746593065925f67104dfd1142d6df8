All of the seizures that accompany the operation have now stopped as well&sbquo; his speech is improving&sbquo; although that will take some time&sbquo;&rdquo; Balton said.&ldquo;But his condition still remains unpredictable with no time frames for recovery.&rdquo;Balton emphasised it would be the Kathrada Foundation and close family who would make any pronouncements if Kathrada&rsquo;s medical condition should deteriorate at all.Kathrada was among liberation movement leaders of uMkhonto we Sizwe and the ANC arrested at Liliesleaf in July 1963.Found guilty along with Nelson Mandela and the other Rivonia Trialists&sbquo; he spent 26 years and three months in jail on Robben Island.- TMG Digital Need to stay informed?
