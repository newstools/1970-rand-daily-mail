Young, legal director for the ACLU of Georgia.Georgia law requires that clerks allow any name chosen by the parents as long as it is not provocative or offensive, Young said in a phone interview. The department relented on Friday, and the ACLU dropped the suit.Nihad Awad, national director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that while many people have names that are derivations of Allah, such as Abdullah, which means "servant of God," using "Allah" as a stand-alone surname was not culturally acceptable."You would never use just Allah. That would be considered very inappropriate," Awad said in a phone interview.Young said he did not know if the couple were Muslim but that he considered the question legally irrelevant.Handy and Walk, who were not available for comment, live together in Atlanta and are expecting a fourth child, Young said."This is an important vindication of parental rights," Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, said in a statement. "No one wants to live in a world where the government can dictate what you can and cannot name your child."A spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Health declined to comment on the matter.- Reuters Need to stay informed?
