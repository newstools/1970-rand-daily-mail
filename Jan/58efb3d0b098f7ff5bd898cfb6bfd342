She butted heads with opposition MPs who said that she was dodging the issue.She however told MPs that the grants issue was &ldquo;very important&rdquo; and she did not want South Africans &ldquo;thinking that I am arrogant.&rdquo;She also made several reassurances that grants would be paid on time when the current contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) comes to an end on March 31.However&sbquo; MPs across all party lines were concerned that the re-negotation of the contract with CPS at the 11th hour&sbquo; did not address the company's BEE status&sbquo; especially in light of her own comments to the committee that she wanted grant money to &ldquo;go where the people are&rdquo; and ensure that it went to developing communities rather than &ldquo;big retailers&rdquo; where it is currently spent.IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa asked whether the company was BEE compliant&sbquo; given that it was &ldquo;a white-owned&sbquo; American-owned&rdquo; company while the EFF's Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said&sbquo; &ldquo;CPS is not BEE compliant&sbquo; why are you in negotiations with them if you believe in radical economic transformation&rdquo;?He said that black people were relegated to doing &ldquo;gardens and small deals&rdquo;.ANC MP Nyami Booi also questioned who the BEE partners were and said Zuma had focused his SONA address on radical economic transformation.&ldquo;These guys are getting richer than us [South Africans] and they may be a private company but it is government revenue that is assisting them.&rdquo;Dlamini however side-stepped the question saying that all matters of CPS' BEE compliance had been dealt with in the Constitutional Court.She also side-stepped questions about what the new CPS contract would cost&sbquo; saying negotiations were still underway.Officials from her department and the South African Social Security Agency met for three days of negotiations last week. And while talks have been completed&sbquo; no deal has been signed yet.Dlamini said the current cost stood at R16.44 per grant&sbquo; for a total of 11 million payments. There are currently about 17 million grant recipients&sbquo; but Dlamini explained that in some instances a number of grants are paid into one account&sbquo; bringing the total number of payments to 11 million.She insisted that the department would remain within its budget as Treasury had already indicated that there are no additional funds available. - TMG Digital/The Times Need to stay informed?
