'Sapo is capable of delivering a robust interim solution in 3 - 6 months covering current services delivered by Cash Paymaster Service''If you want to do anything with that tender go back to the Constitutional Court''I don't want load shedding to return and we have been assured of continued support from Eskom so that we continue to have the country supplied with power''This study really gives us a glimpse of what was in a Neanderthal's medicine cabinet''At both a national and regional level, Europe s leaders appear to be suffering a crisis of confidence, popularity and at worst political legitimacy''I micro-analysed every aspect of the process from temperature to humidity water activity and air movement''Any loss of money is regrettable. Don't take it that R118 million lost means nothing; it means a lot. We went out of our way to secure the games - but not at all costs''It is a place of infinite suffering and utter despair, echoing with the wailing of the damned'The SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) appears not to have answered the Constitutional Court&rsquo;s questions about the proposed renewal of the Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) grant payment deal.The agency had been given until 4pm on Monday to answer the court&rsquo;s questions&sbquo; but seems to have missed the deadline. Officials at the Constitutional Court&rsquo;s Registrar&rsquo;s Office confirmed at close of business yesterday they had not received paper filings in response to the court&rsquo;s request.Attempts to get clarity from the Office of the Chief Justice and Sassa were unsuccessful.Last week the Constitutional Court asked the agency to explain why it would not be able to take over the payment of grants as it had promised the court it would do. The court also wanted to know who was responsibile and who in Sassa knew and when they knew it could not manage to take over grant payments come April 1.The existing contract concludes at the end of March and the agency is negotiating a deal to extend the contract with CPS outside of a normal tender process.Instead of meeting its 4 pm deadline to give 17 answers explaining what led to the current situation Sassa appears to have filed papers in response to a different court case brought by NGOs Black Sash and Freedom Under Law.In this case due to be heard on Wednesday the NGOs have asked the Constitutional Court to supervise any new deal Sassa makes to ensure the paying of grants.The agency has agreed to these requests and even proposed a draft order the court could make giving it authority to supervise any interim contract for grant payments.Sassa has said it does not oppose Black Sash's request and has offered to give quarterly reports on how it will ensure payments of grants in future. It suggested the auditor general or public protector help the court supervise Sassa plans to ensure social grants are paidCPS also filed papers on Monday saying it had no problem with being supervised by the court should it enter into a new contract with the agency.CPS told the court it does not want to be involved in the long-term payment of grants saying the controversy the court cases and the uncertainity over who would take over in April had damaged its reputation.It however said it would not leave Sassa unable to pay grants in April and could help in a interim arrangement with grant payments.But Sassa has opposed Freedom Under Law's requests to get involved with specifics of the contract with CPS.Sassa says it does not want the court to determine the price and length of contract it has with CPS in future and says the court does not have jurisdiction to get involved in such detail. - TMG Digital Need to stay informed?
