Is there life elsewhere in the universe?" said study researcher Matthew Dodd, a University College London biogeochemist.The scientists said the primordial microbes' structure closely resembled modern bacteria that dwell near iron-rich hydrothermal vents. They believe that, like their modern counterparts, they were iron-eaters. The rock's composition was consistent with a deep-sea vent environment."This is important for the origin of life," said study researcher Dominic Papineau, a University College London astrobiologist. "It shows microbial life diversified to specialized microbes very early in Earth history."It is also important for the evolution of life. It shows that some microbes have not changed significantly" since Earth's early times, Papineau said.Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and the oceans appeared about 4.4 billion years ago. If the fossils are indeed 4.28 billion years old, that would suggest "an almost instantaneous emergence of life" after ocean formation, Dodd said.The fossils appear to be older than any other previously discovered evidence of life. For example, other scientists last year described 3.7 billion-year-old fossilized microbial mats, called stromatolites, from Greenland.- Reuters Need to stay informed?
