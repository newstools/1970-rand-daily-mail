From crying crocodile tears to becoming a member of Parliament, here is a timeline dating Eskom CEO Brian Molefe s activity since the state of capture report was releasedPolitical analyst Protas Madlala said the ANC s humiliating defeat was a "serious indictment that should get the party worried"'A flight from a reserve currency would throw the global trading system into disarray'"Made it to space. Team delighted," Rocket Lab said on its official Twitter account'It was a huge explosion - you could feel it in your chest. It was chaotic. Everybody was running and screaming and just trying to get out''Oh my god. Trump has obtained the Bajoran Orb of Time''We had to focus. Manchester - we won for them. We played for England, we played for Manchester and we played for them -- the people who died'What could make your life so utterly pointless that you would give yourself up to die in a suicide that takes the lives of those whose lives have not yet begun?Rocket Lab, a Silicon Valley-funded space launch company, on Thursday launched the maiden flight of its battery-powered, 3-D printed rocket from New Zealand's remote Mahia Peninsula."Made it to space. Team delighted," Rocket Lab said on its official Twitter account.The successful launch of a low cost, 3D-printed rocket is an important step in the commercial race to bring down financial and logistical barriers to space while also making New Zealand an unlikely space hub.The Los Angeles and New Zealand-based rocket firm has touted its service as a way for companies to get satellites into orbit regularly."Our focus with the Electron has been to develop a reliable launch vehicle that can be manufactured in high volumes our ultimate goal is to make space accessible by providing an unprecedented frequency of launch opportunities," said Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and chief executive in a statement.The firm had spent the past four years preparing for the test launch and last week received the go-ahead from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which is monitoring the flight.Bad weather had delayed the rocket from taking off three times this week.New Zealand has created new rocket legislation and set up a space agency in anticipation of becoming a low-cost space hub.Ships and planes need re-routing every time a rocket is launched, which limits opportunities in crowded U.S. skies, but New Zealand, a country of 4 million people in the South Pacific, has only Antarctica to its south. The country is also well-positioned to send satellites bound for a north-to-south orbit around the poles.But many locals in the predominantly M ori community were not happy with access to public areas blocked."People come to Mahia so they can go to the beach and it's been chopped off now and by the sounds of it one of these rockets are going to be launching one every 30 days so they've taken over our lifestyle," said Mahia farmer Pua Taumata.But Taumata also said the programme could bring opportunities."I'm for technology ... a lot of things could come of it through education. It gives our children something different in their careers. Nobody thought to get into the space industry (before now)," he said.Rocket Lab is one of about 30 companies and agencies worldwide developing small satellite launchers as an alternative to firms jostling for space on larger launches or paying around $50 million (38.5 million pounds) for a dedicated service. The company said in a statement it has now received $148 million in funding and is valued in excess of $1 billion.Rocket Lab's customers include NASA, earth-imaging firm Planet and startups Spire and Moon Express.The firm will carry out two more tests before it starts commercial operations, slated to begin towards the end of this year.- Reuters Need to stay informed?
