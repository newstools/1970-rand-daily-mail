We &ldquo;continue to see the severely weakened financial condition of state-owned enterprises as a significant risk to the country&rsquo;s fiscal health,&rdquo; it said.These are some of the worst-affected institutions:The utility, which provides about 90 percent of South Africa&rsquo;s power,&nbsp;is struggling to match supply and demand. Eskom last year stalled the sign-off of government-brokered deals to buy green power from independent producers, which were contracted to develop plants after shortages resulted in electricity cuts from 2008, saying it had spare capacity of its own.When the government directed Eskom to conclude the accords, the utility said it would close several old coal-fired plants and terminate agreements with 48 coal-transport companies -- an announcement that spurred truck drivers to blockade roads in the capital, Pretoria.An investigation, which was halted by the company, showed some suppliers were favored despite higher costs. Eskom has had an acting chief executive officer since November when Brian Molefe resigned after being implicated in a graft ombudsman s report.The state carrier expects its annual loss to widen to 3.5 billion rand ($280 million) in the year through March 30, from 1.5 billion rand the year before.

While the Constitutional Court ruled three years ago that a contract Sassa issued to Net1 UEPS Technologies Inc. to distribute the grants was invalid because tender rules weren t followed, the agency failed to appoint a replacement and couldn t take on the job itself. On March 17, the court castigated Sassa and said Net1 should continue distributing the monthly stipends for another year to give the agency time to get its house in order.The state oil and gas company lost 14.6 billion rand in the year through March 2015, mainly because of a writedown on its offshore Ikhwezi natural gas project, and a further 1.1 billion rand impairment is anticipated this financial year. PetroSA sees no let-up in its challenges for at least the next three years. The company last had a permanent chief executive officer in 2015.The commuter rail service has lurched from one management crisis to the next. Its CEO, Lucky Montana, was fired in 2015 after a clash with the board, which accused management of concluding a number of irregular contracts worth billions of rand and asked the High Court to annul them. Acting CEO Collins Letsoalo was fired last month, following media reports that he gave himself a 350 percent salary increase.
