Major General Andre Lincoln said a hand-crafted rifle - which would have been used in the hit - was found under the desk of a senior SAPS member in Pretoria'The minister does not respect the law and has no idea what the constitution behoves her to do. We have an ignoramus in office''I don't want load shedding to return and we have been assured of continued support from Eskom so that we continue to have the country supplied with power''This study really gives us a glimpse of what was in a Neanderthal's medicine cabinet'Japan's flag-flying operation comes as the United States under President Donald Trump appears to be taking a tougher line with China'This is the first time it has been shown that bumblebees can tell the difference between their scent and the scent of their family members''The Commonwealth Games Federation is looking for an alternative to Durban''Maybe the minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini was told that story at her mother s knee. It would explain how she deals with unethical behaviour'The ANC wants a greater concentration of power in the Presidency in the government.The party says President Jacob Zuma's office is the strategic centre of power in the government and therefore should have a dedicated department for state policy and planning needs.These include looking at the capacity of the state, the allocation of funding according to priorities, ensuring the government delivers on its promises and co-ordinating the work of other spheres of government, such as state-owned entities."The strategic centre of government in the Presidency must ensure that strong capacity is deployed in all branches of the state to ensure that the national democratic revolution is advanced."The centre of government must establish central organising machinery for optimal deployment of talent across the spheres of government [and] become a clearing house for senior appointments, succession planning and career development," the ANC said in a policy discussion document made public yesterday.Although ANC head of policy Jeff Radebe could not elaborate on how the proposed policy of giving the Presidency more powers would work, he said it would be clear only after the policy conference how the department for state policy and planning would function.Currently, there is unhappiness with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, with some of his colleagues accusing him of not allocating funds to projects that will alleviate poverty.The creation of this department in Zuma's office could be seen as a way to rein in Gordhan.The documents reveal the ANC intends crafting legislation to "dismantle the monopoly" of "white-owned" print media houses.Jackson Mthembu, chairman of the ANC's subcommittee on communications, said print media ownership needed to reflect South Africa's demographics."We are saying no, there must be change. Ownership patterns of the media must represent the people of South Africa as a whole. It can't be limited to a few people who are white-skinned and male; that's the point we're making."The ANC has proposed that state-owned development finance institutions, such the National Empowerment Fund, be lobbied to "support this transformation of the media".- Times Media Need to stay informed?
