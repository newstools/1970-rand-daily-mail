When Breitenbach attempted a counter-punch&sbquo; telling the court it must &ldquo;not jump&rdquo; to adverse conclusions about the minister&sbquo; he was quickly reminded of the pecking order.Mogoeng said it was incumbent upon counsel to mind their language.&ldquo;We remain bound by an oath of office to do the right thing. Decorum of the court does not permit counsel to warn us. We are very responsible people. We are not warned by officers of the court.&rdquo;Mogoeng ended his grilling with one last biting question directed at Breitenbach&rsquo;s client&sbquo; Dlamini: "I genuinely want to understand&hellip; How do you get to the level where [your clients] make themselves look like they are incompetent? &hellip; How did we get to this level that can be characterised as absolute incompetence?&rdquo;Breitenbach was not the only advocate to find him or herself on the receiving end of some difficult questions.When Advocate Aslam Bava SC representing the South African Post Office (Sapo) told the court his client was ready and able to take over grant payments&sbquo; Mogoeng asked: &ldquo;How do we take SAPO seriously if it says it needs just one month when there is not even a contract in place?&rdquo;He followed this up with a question about the Post Office&rsquo;s "admirable track record in service delivery&sbquo;" prompting laughter from the public gallery.It was also a tough day in court for Advocate Alfred Cockrell&sbquo; SC&sbquo; representing CPS who had an uphill battle convincing judges that his client needed a new contract&sbquo; and soon&sbquo; if it were to pay the grants on time.When it was suggested that the court could instruct Treasury to pay CPS the money without a contract&sbquo; Cockrell described the idea as &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo;.Judgment was reserved.&nbsp;- TMG Digital Need to stay informed?
