'Police must be ruthless against those who are armed'Cyril Ramaphosa made several veiled attacks on Jacob Zuma, who s backing his ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, for the presidencyA captured South African Treasury is bad news for the country's poor but the view that the capture is a natural enemy of the market economy is a mythScientists might be the worst possible defenders of science because they are comfortable with uncertainty and are willing to admit what they don't knowAfter qualifying for the May 7 runoff alongside Marine Le Pen, the political rookie gave a speech that observers said would have been suited to a full election winThe Pobrezje cemetery on the outskirts of Maribor, Slovenia's second largest city, recently set up a prototype of a weather-proof and vandal-proof digital tombstone that can interact with visitorsBaxter has also made additional requests for a car cellphone overseas travel allowance housing allowance and special performance bonusesA university student in sociology would learn much more from a morning in a Metrorail third-class carriage than in a seminar room on campusBerning Ntlemeza who has been instructed by Police Minister Fikile Mbalula not to report for duty as head of the Hawks might be correct in insisting on doing so.In March the high court in Pretoria reviewed and set aside Ntlemeza s appointment as head of the Hawks.The judgment followed a high court judgment in 2015 where the court held that Ntlemeza lacked integrity and honour and had made false statements under oath.On April 12 the newly appointed minister Mbalula withdrew his application for leave to appeal against the March judgment.However Ntlemeza went ahead with his application for leave to appeal and his application was dismissed with costs.During the same hearing in Pretoria the Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom under Law sought an enforcement and execution of the March order despite pending appeals.The court granted their application.Mbalula relies on the judgments of the high court in March and April and insists Ntlemeza should not report for duty.However Ntlemeza on Friday petitioned the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) against the orders of the high court.His view is based on the Superior Courts Act which states that if a court grants an execution of its earlier order it should immediately furnish reasons for doing so.Section 18(4)(ii) of the Act also states that the aggrieved party has an automatic right of appeal to the next highest court.The Act states that such execution order should be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal.Ntlemeza s lawyer Comfort Ngidi referred to a judgment in the Supreme Court of Appeal in November last year which for the first time dealt with an automatic right of appeal under Section 18(4)(ii).The University of Free State was appealing against the judgment of the Free State High Court which directed that its judgment and order delivered on 21 July 2016 not be suspended pending the determination of an appeal by the UFS to the Constitutional Court alternatively to the SCA.The court held that the applicant for the execution order had to prove the existence of exceptional circumstances and show that the other party will not suffer irreparable harm.The SCA upheld the university s appeal. The appeal court found that AfriForum had not shown that exceptional circumstances existed for the implementation order.TMG Digital Need to stay informed?
